# Wanez :: GD-MOD (v0.1.0) #

Unofficial MOD for Grim Dawn. This is the full MOD's source with all of its parts. Right now Wanez is literally just DGA and some additional stuff, but in the future it will have everything in it I am working on (DGA, Masteries, Items, etc.), everything will be available as a separate MOD for those who wish to include only some of these parts in their MOD/Compilation.

Every part has its own Version, this probably makes it confusing, but I believe it's the best way for others to keep track of updates of the parts they wish to use. If you are just here for Runic Inscriptions than there is no reason to update if the latest version of Wanez doesn't have an Update for Runic Inscriptions. 

**In Progress:** You will have to download the full source and use the MOD-Splitter Tool to get the parts you want.
